    "summary": "This book tells the story of the leveraged buyout (LBO) of RJ Reynolds Nabisco, detailing the greed and excess of corporate America in the 1980s.",
    "thoughts": [
    "RJ Reynolds was a large family tobacco business that merged with Nabisco Brands in 1985.",
    "This story doesn't focus on one character but rather bounces between perspectives of the main players in the LBO.",
    "Some of the LBO talk was pretty complicated but essentially, an LBO involved borrowing lots of money to buy a company.",
    "Ross Johnson was the CEO of RJR Nabisco during the buyout talks and formed a management team to buy the company for themselves.",
    "They weren't expecting anyone to be able to match their huge bid which is when this story gets interesting."

      "While reading I got to wondering about the cigarette industry of the 1980s and who exactly was doing the most smoking.",
      "RJR's corporate headquarters were in North Carolina, as well as most of their manufacturing.",
      "So it's no surprise that (based on the map) they were getting high on their own supply.",
      "Seems like no coincidence that New Hampshire is shaped like a chimney",
      "And it looks like 80s Vegas was pulling its weight.",
      "One other standout is Utah...not too surprising considering the Mormon population. It appears they aren't big smokers."

    "thoughts": [
    "Fracking involves applying hydraulic pressure to shale rock in order to liberate more oil/gas from the rock.",
    "It's considered an 'unconventional' method of extracting oil/gas - conventional methods are less complicated (i.e., drill a hole and allow the oil/gas to come out through natural pressure.)",
    "I read this a long time ago so I don't remember many details about the companies and characters involved, I just thought it'd be easy to make a map related to it.",
    "I recall the story is mostly told though the eyes of former Chesapeake Energy CEO Aubrey McClendon and highlights his rise to fame."

      "I recently moved to New York (Buffalo), a state where fracking is banned completely due to environmental concerns.",
      "It has been linked to increased earthquake activity in several other regions where it is performed.",
      "I thought it might be interesting to see a comparison to a neighboring state where fracking is legal.",
      "Pennsylvania has massive hydrocarbon reserves in the Marcellus Shale geological formation which is present across much of the state (west of the Appalachian range).",
      "The map on the left shows a point at each fracked well. I'd take this with a grain of salt as I just plotted coorinates from a public 'Unconventional Well' dataset for Pennsylvania. ",
      "I suppose there may be other unconventional methods of extraction that aren't fracking.",
      "That's ok ... I just wanted to get some data on the page and look at it.",
      "It's a similar story for the NY State dataset.",
      "I filtered that dataset for 'Horizontal' wells, and while horizontal drilling often indicates fracking I suppose there are times when that isn't the case.",
      "Since there are many overlapping points on the first map I thought it would be useful to show a density grid for the points to better capture the data.",
      "For each 'cell' or 'pixel' in the area the number of points in that cell are summed.",
      "There are probably more interesting things I could do with these huge datasets but for now this is what you get."
