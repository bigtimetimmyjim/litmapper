    "thoughts": [
    "RJ Reynolds was a large family tobacco business that merged with Nabisco Brands in 1985.",
    "This story doesn't focus on one character but rather bounces between perspectives of the main players in the LBO.",
    "Some of the LBO talk was pretty complicated but essentially, an LBO involved borrowing lots of money to buy a company.",
    "Ross Johnson was the CEO of RJR Nabisco during the buyout talks and formed a management team to buy the company for themselves.",
    "They weren't expecting anyone to be able to match their huge bid which is when this story gets interesting."

      "So it's no surprise that (based on the map) they were getting high on their own supply.",
      "Seems like no coincidence that New Hampshire is shaped like a chimney",
      "And it looks like 80s Vegas was pulling its weight.",
      "One other standout is Utah...not too surprising considering the Mormon population. It appears they aren't big smokers."

    "It's considered an 'unconventional' method of extracting oil/gas - conventional methods are less complicated (i.e., drill a hole and allow the oil/gas to come out through natural pressure.)",

      "Pennsylvania has massive hydrocarbon reserves in the Marcellus Shale geological formation which is present across much of the state (west of the Appalachian range).",
      "The map on the left shows a point at each fracked well. I'd take this with a grain of salt as I just plotted coorinates from a public 'Unconventional Well' dataset for Pennsylvania. ",
      "I suppose there may be other unconventional methods of extraction that aren't fracking.",
      "That's ok ... I just wanted to get some data on the page and look at it.",
      "It's a similar story for the NY State dataset.",
      "I filtered that dataset for 'Horizontal' wells, and while horizontal drilling often indicates fracking I suppose there are times when that isn't the case.",
      "Since there are many overlapping points on the first map I thought it would be useful to show a density grid for the points to better capture the data.",
      "For each 'cell' or 'pixel' in the area the number of points in that cell are summed.",
      "There are probably more interesting things I could do with these huge datasets but for now this is what you get."
